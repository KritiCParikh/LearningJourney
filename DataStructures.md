**Data Structure (DS)** refers to the way we store and organize data in a computer so that it can be used effectively. It is crucial for efficiently processing, retrieving, and storing data. Understanding data structures is fundamental to improving the performance of software applications and solving problems more effectively

### Example: Motorcycles and Route Optimization
- **Data Structure:** Graphs  
  Example: When planning a motorcycle trip, a graph can represent various routes where nodes are locations and edges are roads with associated distances or travel times.  
- **Algorithm:** Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm  
  Example: This algorithm can find the shortest path from one location to another, helping riders choose the most efficient route for their journey.

# Data Type vs Data Structures

| **Data Type**                                                                                                                                 | **Data Structure**                                                                                                           |

| **Definition:** A data type is a classification that specifies which type of value a variable can hold and what operations can be performed on it. | **Definition:** A data structure is a way of organizing and storing data in a computer to enable efficient access and modification. |
| **Example:** <br> Integer (int): Represents whole numbers. <br> `age = 25  # age is an integer`                                            | **Example:** <br> Array: A collection of elements identified by an index. <br> `numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]  # 'numbers' is an array of integers` |
