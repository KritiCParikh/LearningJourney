# Data Structure (DS)
DS refers to the way we store and organize data in a computer so that it can be used effectively. It is crucial for efficiently processing, retrieving, and storing data. Understanding data structures is fundamental to improving the performance of software applications and solving problems more effectively

#### Example: Motorcycles and Route Optimization
- **Data Structure:** Graphs  
  Example: When planning a motorcycle trip, a graph can represent various routes where nodes are locations and edges are roads with associated distances or travel times.  
- **Algorithm:** Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm  
  Example: This algorithm can find the shortest path from one location to another, helping riders choose the most efficient route for their journey.

## Key Differences for Beginners

- **Data Types** are the most basic units in programming. They define what kind of data a variable can hold (like numbers or text) and what you can do with it.
- **Abstract Data Types (ADTs)** are like blueprints. They describe what operations you can perform on data without saying exactly how it's done. It's like knowing you can add items to a shopping list without worrying about how the list is stored.
- **Data Structures** are the actual ways we organize data in a computer. They implement ADTs and determine how data is stored and accessed, which affects how quickly operations can be performed.

## Real-Life Example: Library Management System

Let's consider a library management system to illustrate how data types, ADTs, and data structures work together:

### Data Types:
- **String**: For book titles, author names
- **Integer**: For book IDs, publication years
- **Boolean**: For availability status

### Abstract Data Type (ADT): Book Collection
**Operations:**
- Add a book
- Remove a book
- Search for a book
- Check out a book
- Return a book

### Data Structure: Hash Table
- **Implementation** of the Book Collection ADT
- Uses book ID as the key for quick lookups

### Code Example

```python
# Data Types
book_id = 12345  # Integer
title = "The Great Gatsby"  # String
available = True  # Boolean

# ADT: Book Collection (interface)
class BookCollection:
    def add_book(self, book):
        pass
    def remove_book(self, book_id):
        pass
    def search_book(self, title):
        pass
    def check_out_book(self, book_id):
        pass
    def return_book(self, book_id):
        pass

# Data Structure: Hash Table implementation
class LibrarySystem(BookCollection):
    def __init__(self):
        self.books = {}  # Hash table

    def add_book(self, book):
        self.books[book.id] = book

    def search_book(self, title):
        return [book for book in self.books.values() if book.title == title]

# Usage
library = LibrarySystem()
library.add_book(Book(book_id, title, available))
found_book = library.search_book("The Great Gatsby")
```
In this example:

- **Data types** (Integer, String, Boolean) are used to represent basic information about books.
- The **BookCollection ADT** defines the operations without specifying how they're implemented.
- The **LibrarySystem class** uses a hash table (dictionary in Python) as the data structure to efficiently implement the ADT operations.
- This integration allows for a system that's both easy to understand at a high level (through the ADT) and efficient in its operations (through the chosen data structure).

Note: The exact classification and implementation of these data structures can vary slightly between programming languages.

## 1. Primitive Data Types
Primitive data types are the most basic data types provided by a programming language. They are typically pre-defined and directly supported by the system, meaning they store a single value and cannot be decomposed into simpler elements.

   a. **Integer**  
      - **Definition:** A numeric data type used to represent whole numbers.  
      - **Real-Life Example:** Counting the number of items in a cart. If we have 3 racquets and 2 tennis balls, the total quantity of items (5) would be an integer.

   b. **Float**  
      - **Definition:** A data type used to represent decimal (floating-point) numbers.  
      - **Real-Life Example:** Measuring weights in a grocery store. If we buy 2.5 kg of sugar, the quantity is a float.

   c. **String**  
      - **Definition:** A sequence of characters, used to store text.  
      - **Real-Life Example:** The full name (like "Roger Federer") is a string because it is a sequence of characters.

   d. **Boolean**  
      - **Definition:** A data type that can hold one of two values: True or False.  
      - **Real-Life Example:** A light switch can either be ON (True) or OFF (False).
  
## 2.  Non-Primitive (Derived) Data Types
Non-primitive data types are more complex structures created by combining multiple primitive data types. They are typically not defined by the programming language itself but by the programmer, and they allow for the organization of multiple values.

## (i) Linear Data Structures
Linear data structures organize data in a sequential manner, where each element is connected to its previous and next element. This means that elements are stored in a single level or line.

a. **Tuple**
- **Definition**: An ordered and immutable collection of items, meaning you can't modify the items after creating it.
- **Real-Life Example**: Coordinates of a location. For example, `(40.7128, -74.0060)` for New York City is a fixed pair of latitude and longitude values.

### A. Static Data Structures
Static data structures have a fixed size and memory allocation that does not change during execution.

b. **Array**
- **Definition**: A collection of elements, typically of the same data type, stored at contiguous memory locations.
- **Real-Life Example**: Seats in a row of a movie theater. All seats are placed in a fixed, ordered sequence. Arrays are used less in Python compared to lists.

### B. Dynamic Data Structures
Dynamic data structures allow for flexible memory allocation, enabling the size to change during program execution.

c. **List**
- **Definition**: An ordered and mutable collection of items that can hold any data type.
- **Real-Life Example**: A grocery shopping list. You have a list of items you plan to buy, like `[milk, eggs, bread]`, and you can add/remove items as you shop.

d. **Linked List**
  - **Definition**: A linear data structure where elements are stored in nodes, each containing data and a reference (or link) to the next node in the sequence.
  - **Real-Life Example**:  A treasure hunt, where each clue contains information and directions to the next clue's location.
  - **Types**: Singly, Doubly, Circular

e. **Stack**
- **Definition**: A collection of elements that follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle for adding and removing elements..
- **Real-Life Example**: A stack of plates. The last plate you place on the stack is the first one you'll take off.
- **Types**: Array-based, linked list-based.

f. **Queue**
- **Definition**: A collection of elements that follows the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle for adding and removing elements..
- **Real-Life Example**: A line of people waiting at a ticket counter, where the first person to arrive is the first to be served.
- **Types**: Simple, Circular, Priority, Deque

## (ii) Non-Linear Data Structures
Non-linear data structures organize data in a hierarchical or interconnected manner, where each element can have multiple relationships with other elements. This allows for a more complex arrangement than a linear sequence.

a. **Set**
- **Definition**: An unordered collection of unique elements, where no duplicates are allowed.
- **Real-Life Example**: Collection of unique stamps. You canâ€™t have two of the same stamp in your collection.

b. **Dictionary**
- **Definition**: A collection of key-value pairs, where each key maps to a specific value.
- **Real-Life Example**: A dictionary of words and definitions. The word (key) maps to its meaning (value), just like `{"apple": "a fruit", "car": "a vehicle"}`.

c. **Graph**
- **Definition**: A set of nodes connected by edges, used to represent relationships between elements.
- **Real-Life Example**: A social network. Each person is a node, and friendships or connections are edges linking them to other people.
- **Types**: Directed, Undirected, Weighted, Unweighted

d. **Tree**
- **Definition**: A hierarchical data structure with a root value and sub-nodes that form a branching structure.
- **Real-Life Example**: A family tree. The root (ancestor) branches out to children (descendants), forming hierarchical layers.
- **Types**: Binary, AVL, Red-Black, B-tree, Trie

e. **Heap**
- **Definition**: A specialized tree-based data structure that satisfies the heap property, where the parent node is either greater than or equal to (max heap) or less than or equal to (min heap) its children.
- **Real-Life Example**: A company's organizational chart where employees at higher levels have more authority than those below them.
- **Types**: Max, Min, Binomial, Fibonacci

f. **Hash Table**
- **Definition**: A data structure that implements an associative array, where data is stored in key-value pairs, allowing for efficient lookup. A hash function processes each key to generate a unique hash code, which determines where the corresponding value is stored in the table. Collision resolution techniques are employed to handle situations where different keys produce the same hash code.
- **Real-Life Example**: A contacts list in a phone, where each personâ€™s name (key) is associated with their phone number (value). A hash table makes it fast to look up someone's number by their name.
- **Types**: Open-addressing, Chaining
