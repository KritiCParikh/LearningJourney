# Classes and Objects in Python

- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** allows us to model real-world objects in code.
- **Objects** are instances of classes, meaning they represent individual examples of the blueprint (class).
- **Classes** act as blueprints to create objects, defining their attributes (data) and methods (functions).

# Defining a Class
In Python, a class is a blueprint for creating objects, and it can have a special method called a constructor. The constructor is defined by the __init__ method and is automatically called when a new instance (object) of the class is created. This method is used to initialize the object's attributes and set up any necessary state for the object.

If you do not explicitly define a constructor in your class, Python automatically provides a default constructor. The **default constructor** does not take any parameters (other than self) and does not perform any initialization. 

- Use the `class` keyword followed by the class name (capitalized by convention).

```python
class Motorbike:
    pass  # Placeholder for now
```

# Attributes and Methods

- **Attributes**: Characteristics of an object (e.g., a motorbike's `make`, `model`, `year`, `color`).
  
- **Methods**: Functions that define what the object can do (e.g., `drive()` and `stop()`).

```python
class Motorbike:
    def __init__(self, make, model, year, color):
        self.make = make
        self.model = model
        self.year = year
        self.color = color
        
    def drive(self):
        print(f"{self.model} is driving")
        
    def stop(self):
        print(f"{self.model} is stopped")

```
# The `__init__()` Method

- `__init__()` is a special method, known as a **constructor**.
- It initializes the object's attributes when the object is created.
- **Self**: Refers to the specific object being created or used. It allows access to the object's attributes and methods within the class.

# Creating an Object

- To create an object from a class, use the class name and provide the necessary attributes:

```python
motorbike1 = Motorbike("Yamaha", "MT-07", 2024, "Black")
```

# Accessing Attributes and Methods

- You can access an object's attributes and methods using the dot (`.`) operator:

```python
print(motorbike1.make)  # Output: Yamaha
motorbike1.drive()       # Output: MT-07 is driving
motorbike1.stop()        # Output: MT-07 is stopped
```
# Self and Method Calls

- You donâ€™t explicitly pass `self` when calling methods. Python automatically passes the object instance.

```python
motorbike1.drive()  # motorbike1 is passed as self
```
# Creating Multiple Objects

- You can create multiple objects from the same class blueprint.

```python
motorbike2 = Motorbike("Suzuki", "Hayabusa", 2023, "Silver")
motorbike2.drive()  # Output: Hayabusa is driving
```
