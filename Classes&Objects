# Classes and Objects in Python

- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** allows us to model real-world objects in code.
- **Objects** are instances of classes, meaning they represent individual examples of the blueprint (class).
- **Classes** act as blueprints to create objects, defining their attributes (data) and methods (functions).

# Defining a Class

- Use the `class` keyword followed by the class name (capitalized by convention).

```python
class Car:
    pass  # Placeholder for now

# Attributes and Methods

- **Attributes**: Characteristics of an object (e.g., a car's `make`, `model`, `year`, `color`).
  
- **Methods**: Functions that define what the object can do (e.g., `drive()` and `stop()`).

```python
class Car:
    def __init__(self, make, model, year, color):
        self.make = make
        self.model = model
        self.year = year
        self.color = color
        
    def drive(self):
        print(f"{self.model} is driving")
        
    def stop(self):
        print(f"{self.model} is stopped")

# The `__init__()` Method

- `__init__()` is a special method, known as a **constructor**.
- It initializes the object's attributes when the object is created.
- **Self**: Refers to the specific object being created or used. It allows access to the object's attributes and methods within the class.

# Creating an Object

- To create an object from a class, use the class name and provide the necessary attributes:

```python
motorbike1 = Car("Yamaha", "MT-07", 2024, "Black")

# Accessing Attributes and Methods

- You can access an object's attributes and methods using the dot (`.`) operator:

```python
print(motorbike1.make)  # Output: Yamaha
motorbike1.drive()       # Output: MT-07 is driving
motorbike1.stop()        # Output: MT-07 is stopped

# Self and Method Calls

- You donâ€™t explicitly pass `self` when calling methods. Python automatically passes the object instance.

```python
motorbike1.drive()  # motorbike1 is passed as self

# Creating Multiple Objects

- You can create multiple objects from the same class blueprint.

```python
motorbike2 = Car("Suzuki", "Hayabusa", 2023, "Silver")
motorbike2.drive()  # Output: Hayabusa is driving
